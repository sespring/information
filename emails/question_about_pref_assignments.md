 Since several have asked, lt me describe the pref targets that are being set for the NDT.  For teams that are still in contention, our goal is to have ALL pref assignments in the top 50% (with a guarantee that they will never exceed 55%).  I'm confident that the 50% threshold will be met.  For teams that have been eliminated we have a goal of 70% with a guaranteed threshold of 75%.  This is consistent with previous years.

 For mutuality the goal is to have the average for all assignments in "in it" debates be a less than 10% difference for individuals AND for panels.  The maximum difference for individuals will be 24% and 30% for panels but these maximums will be VERY rare.

 The judges who don't have 12 rounds ARE included in the percentage calculations.  We are accommodating their presence in the pool by setting the strike threshold high enough that even if you placed all of those judges at the bottom of your sheet, you would still have as many "strikes" as were offered prior to the inclusion of such judges in the pool several years back.
