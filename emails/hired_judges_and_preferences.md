Hello Everyone,

Congratulations on qualifying your teams to the NDT.  As you are arranging your judging, please remember the following:  

Each year we have a large number of hired judges in the judging pool for the NDT.  On occasion, some of them are difficult to place.  While we strongly encourage hiring judges that increase the diversity of the overall pool we do ask that everyone use discretion in hiring judges when it simply reduces the commitment of a school’s coaching staff.  While we will make efforts to equitably use all judges in the pool, in cases where a school has hired a judge that can’t be placed and other coaches/judges from the school have available rounds, we reserve the right to replace the lost rounds by modifying the commitment of those other judges in consultation with the director of the program.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.  

Sincerely,

Sarah Partlow Lefevre
