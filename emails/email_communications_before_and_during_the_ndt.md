As is the typically the case when I run tournaments, a significant amount of communication occurs using email. 

1) We need all judges to verify that the linked address they have for their entry in tabroom is the preferred address for use during the tournament.

2) Each director should verify with me which of their affiliated judges should be included in communications to the squad (entry confirmations, pref sheet confirmation, decisions, etc.).  I will send to as many or as few as each director stipulates.  You can communicate that directly to me.

3) Unlike the invitationals that I tab, the email confirmations of ballot decisions will not include points (they are not disclosed until after prelims).  But coaches will receive decisions after all three ballots in a round are received and the decision is announced.

4) Tabroom will be updated after all debates have been tabulated for a round, but I will have a file in the cloud (box.com) that provides real-time updates.

Other operational info will be provided when we get closer to the start of the tournament.
