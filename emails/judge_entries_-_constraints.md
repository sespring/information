Judging is just about set - only one school still has to supply judging and I need confirmation from a couple of districts regarding the extra two rounds.  Thanks for everyone's work on this.

The next task is to make sure that all of your constraints are recorded - including hired judges who are constrained from the school(s) that have hired them.  I'll send out confirmations at the end of the work so that everything gets double- and triple-checked.

THANKS
