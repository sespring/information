Thanks to everyone for making sure that we have all of your details for the 2016 NDT.  At this point, final numbers have been provided to the catering staff. 
 
If you find you need to add people, please email: [nationaldebatetournament@gmail.com](mailto:nationaldebatetournament@gmail.com).
 
 Unfortunately, this means that we will be unable to reimburse costs for any unexpected drops from your entry unless another team is asking to increase their entry total.
 
Registration will take place on Thursday, March 31, at the Tournament Hotel (room will be posted and you can also inquire at the front desk). Registration begins at 9am.
