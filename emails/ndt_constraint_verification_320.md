 On Thursday, I sent all 224 NDT judges a request to verify their constraints.  As of this point, 146 have confirmed their constraints (either as originally submitted or after additions I made on their behalf).  Another 23 have submitted changes that I have made and re-released that haven't yet been confirmed.  And 55 have not yet responded to the initial email.

I need all 224 judges to verify their constraints before we begin to collect prefs.  This is a process that typically happens manually at the tournament iteself.

During the process we have learned a couple of things about prefs recorded in tabroom.  A number of you have indicated that I was missing prefs that you have submitted to tabroom.  A couple of different things happen.  First, most tournaments permit the option of entering constraints that are effective only for that tournament.  Those constraints are NOT permanent.  A second alternative is to enter permanent or "standing" constraints.  Many of you have done that.  But over time, schools, competitors and judges can all get duplicate or nearly duplicate records in tabroom.  Unfortunately, a number of permanent constraints don't synch up because of these anomalies and as a result the constraint isn't recognized for the current tournament.  Additionally, some of you have indicated that you aren't able to correctly constrain a competitor, typically due to how that record is linked (or not linked) in tabroom.

As a result, I wil personally ensure that all of the constraints you report to me get applied at the NDT even if they don't seem to apply in tabroom.

More critically, it is important that everyone carefully examine the list of teams that I provided to ensure that all of the constraints are correct even if you already confirmed it.  Some of you may be assuming that since you entered a constraint in the past that I will for sure have it.  Don't make that assumption.

My apologies for the extra efforts.  But in the process we will significantly improve the accuracy of the records.
