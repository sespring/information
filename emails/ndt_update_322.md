 The pref sheet for the NDT will go live tomorrow.  Before that happens, I still want to hear from 16 judges who I don't believe that have verified their constraints.  If you're on the list, contact me ASAP.  If someone from your school is on the list, contact them ASAP.

Once the pref sheet goes live, we ask that nobody change their judging commitments in tabroom.  If something needs to change, contact me directly.

If you are filling out your prefs and you see a judge who you believe should have constrained themselves but missed it, contact me and Sarah. 

#### Judges needing to verify constraints:
* Allen, Ben - Hired
* Bato, Christian - Southern California
* Brunson, Dashawnta - Missouri - Kansas City
* Cherry, Kaine - Southern California
* Evans, Ignacio - Vermont
* Hirn, Kevin - Michigan
* Jackson, Jalisa - Kansas State
* Markoff, Andrew - Georgetown
* Maurer, Samuel - Wichita State
* McElhinny, Colin - Kentucky
* Phillips, Scott - Michigan
* Reed, Andrea - Northwestern
* Rollins, Joel - Texas
* Ruffin, Ameena - Binghamton
* Spies, Stephanie - Northwestern
* Thach, Lee - Cal State Fullerton
