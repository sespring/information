Hello Everyone,

I hope your preparations for the NDT are going well.  I have a few rule reminders that you and your students should review and be familiar with.  The NDT is unique in that it is the only tournament of the year where the rules are made through community negotiation.   Each district has a representative that helps to negotiate NDT rules and represents the district's views.  NDT committee meetings are held at NCA, in the spring at Texas/NU, and at the NDT.  A complete copy of the rules can be found at http://nationaldebatetournament.org/rules/

 Thanks,

Sarah T. Partlow Lefevre

Director, NDT

## Announcements
Please remember that:

1. There are no mavericks allowed at the NDT.  Mavericks are not acceptable even for one debate (loss and zero points.)  No substitutes. (Rule II Section D-4)

2. There is a conduct code which prohibits harassing, abusive, violent, etc. behavior.  There is a panel that is prepared to enforce it.  The conduct code requires all coaches and debaters to review prior to the tournament.  I have included the full text of the conduct code in this email. (Rule I Section C). 
  3. Standing Rules and conduct code can be accessed at: http://nationaldebatetournament.org/rules/ 
  4. Conduct code procedures can be found at: http://nationaldebatetournament.org/key-documents/conductprocedures/ 
5. All contests are open to participants and invited guests and may be recorded (Rule IV Section F-1) by same.
6. We have an official scouting system.  Participation by undergraduates in attendance and not debating is mandatory.  All teams must make printed materials available for inspection by the scouts at the end of the debates. (Rule IV Section F-6).
7. The NDT Committee recently adopted rules prohibiting clipping, in effect for the first time at this NDT. (Rule VII Section B)
8. We've done all we can to make the tournament accessible to everyone. If something comes up, we have an accessibility coordinator whose contact info is published.
9. The NDT rules grant the tabroom the authority to assign judges for all debates. Rule VII Section B states, “judges are assigned according to the discretion of the Director.” Therefore, the tabroom will only accept ballots from the judges who have been assigned to judge a debate.
10. No-show judges are subject to fines up to $500 and further sanctions in case of repeat offenses.  I will enforce these sanctions immediately against judges not present at the appointed start time of the rounds. Late judges require that the whole tournament be delayed.  Think about this:  if you delay the tournament just ten minutes for all 400 plus people in attendance, that's 4000 person-minutes, or about 67 hours.  At the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, that's about $500.  So if you show up late to your debates, bring your checkbook!
11. No smoking and no alcohol or controlled substances in any competition space. (Rule IV Section F-4 and F-5).
12. “Individuals in attendance at the National Debate Tournament who provide significant coaching to, or argument production for, any team participating in the NDT should be required to enter the judging pool on a supplemental strike sheet for at least four debates or, if it is more appropriate, provide a significant equivalent contribution to the tournament as defined by the tournament host or director.” (Rule IV Section F-9)
