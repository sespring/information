 As you arrange for your judging, one of the recurring issues that we have to confront is to make sure that we have all and only the appropriate constraints for every judge in the pool.  Each year we have some that are missed by the judges (but typically caught by the students).  But leaving constraints open to students permits them to overgenerate constraints by marking judges that don't have a genuine conflict.

As a result, we are going to endeavor to have all constraints entered AND signed off by judges before opening the system to prefs.  On the Monday prior to the tournament, each judge will get an email verification of all of the 78 teams in the tournament and whether they are or are not a constraint.  We will ask judges to return that verification to both Sarah and to me.

As a reminder, in addition to normal rules for identifying constraints, if you have HIRED a judge for the tournament, they should mark themselves as constrained for your teams.  As you enter judges, make sure that each judge double-checks their constraints in tabroom.
