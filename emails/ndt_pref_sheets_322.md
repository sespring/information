# NDT Pref Sheets 3/22

For the sake of those completing pref sheets, here are the judges that have not heard 12 rounds this year.  I've also been asked about the fact that teams don't have the option of constraining judges.  That is correct.  If you have a judge that you believe should have constrained themselves but missed it, please communicate that constraint directly to me.  Our goal is to have 100% accuracy.
